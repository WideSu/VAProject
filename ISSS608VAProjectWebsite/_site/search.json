Overview\nIn this project, our team will try on building web-enabled visual\nanalytics application by using R Shiny. The project aims to democratize\ndata and analytics. The application will focus and emphasize on\ninteractivity and effective integration of techniques from data\nanalytics and data visualization.\n2. Project Topic\nThe topic of Visual Analytics Project will be based on VAST Challenge 2022.\nOur team will choose Challenge 1 and build a Shiny Application to answer\nthe questions of the Challenge. Challenge 1 is to understand the city’s\ndemographics and relationships. We will analyse the available data about\nthe social networks and other information of the city to learn about the\ncity’s demographics, its neighborhoods, and its business base.\n3. Motivation\nThe purpose of the project is to help the city planning team of\nEngagement, Ohio USA to understand the current state of the city and\nidentify opportunities for future growth. The visual analytics exercise\ncan use related visual analytic techniques to analyse the data collected\nfrom the representative residents using the city’s urban planning\napp.\n4. Problems and Issues\nIn this project, we will solve three main problems of Challenge 1.\nFirst, assuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s\npopulation, we will characterize the demographics of the town. Also,\nconsidering the social activities in the community, we will describe the\npatterns in the social networks in the town. Lastly, we will identify\nthe predominant business base of the town, and describe patterns we\nobserve.\n5. Related Work and Approach\nXXXX\n6. Storyboards and Prototypes\nXXXX\n\n\n\n",
