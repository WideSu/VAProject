Modules in Shiny\r\nApplication\r\nThe Shiny application provides 3 main modules to cover different\r\nareas of analysis.\r\nDemographics Analysis: aims to help users to\r\ncharacterize what they can tell about the demographics of the\r\ntown.\r\nSocial Activity: aims to help users to explore\r\nthe social activities in the community and identify patterns observed in\r\nthe social networks in the town.\r\nPredominant Business: aims to help users to\r\ndescribe patterns of the neighborhoods and identify the predominant\r\nbusiness base of the town.\r\n\r\n2.1 Demographics Analysis\r\nUnder Demographics Analysis, the application provides sub modules\r\nfor:\r\nOverall Demographics\r\nWage Analysis\r\nExpenditure Analysis\r\n\r\n2.1.1 Overall Demographics\r\nAfter selecting “Overall Demographics” from the menu bar, users will\r\nsee a dashboard providing basic summaries of the demographics in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWhen mouse over the first plot, the monthly wage of each participant\r\nin the city will be shown.\r\n\r\nThe next plot shows the distribution of participants in different age\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nThe rightmost plot shows the distribution of participants by\r\neducation level.\r\n\r\nIn the next row, 2 plots will be shown namely the percentage of\r\nparticipants with kids in each age group and average monthly wage by\r\neducation level.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth plots are generated using plotly so users are\r\nable to zoom in/out the plot and perform other functions such as\r\ndownload.\r\n\r\nIn the next row, first a box violin plot will be shown with pairwise\r\nstatistical test on participant’s joviality by education level.\r\n\r\nThe other plot is the correlogram for the relationship between\r\nparticipant’s joviality and wage.\r\n\r\n2.1.2 Wage Analysis\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nAfter selecting the Wage Analysis from the side menu bar, user will\r\nbe able to see the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tab with the first\r\nbox plot for wage distribution in different groups.\r\nUsers can select the option for “Group by” from the dropdown list.\r\n\r\nOn the right, user can adjust the date range and select factor to\r\nview the box violin plot that helps to explore factors that influence\r\nresidents’ wage. \r\nUsers can scroll down to view the participants’ wage and their\r\naverage with different selection criteria such as education level, age\r\ngroup and have kids or not.\r\nMore details of the participant will be shown in the tooltip after\r\nuser mouse over to the individual point in the plot.\r\n\r\nCrucial Factors\r\nUser can switch to the 2nd tab for crucial factors that affect\r\npeople’s wage. In this tab, the minimum, maximum and mean of wage will\r\nbe shown on top, followed by distribution of wage over time period.\r\n\r\nNext, another 4 plots will be shown to illustrate the wage difference\r\nby education level, joviality status, age group, and having kids or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData Table\r\nUser can switch to the 3rd tab that provides a data table of the\r\nresidents’ data where users can search for any key word in the search\r\nfield and perform sorting if requried.\r\n\r\n2.1.3 Expenditure Analysis\r\nAfter selecting the Expenditure Analysis from the side menu bar, the\r\nheatmap of daily expenses of residents will be shown where users can\r\nidentify the day of the month or week when residents usually spend more\r\nor less.\r\n\r\nUser can scroll down to use the scatter plot for income and expense\r\nanalysis and select the data by different groups. A data table for 4\r\ncategories of expenses with the Sparkline charts will be shown in the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n2.2 Social Activity\r\nUnder Social Activity Analysis, the application provides sub modules\r\nfor:\r\nOverall Social Network\r\nNetwork by Group\r\nNetwork by Individual\r\n\r\n2.2.1 Overall Social Network\r\nUser can select Overall Social Network from the side menu bar and\r\nthen a social network diagram for all the participants will be\r\nshown.\r\nUser can adjust the year and month to see the development of network\r\nover time.\r\n\r\nNotes: participants with relatively higher centrality betweenness\r\nvalue are highlighted in red in the diagram.\r\n2.2.2 Network by Group\r\nUser can go to the Network by Group menu item to explore the social\r\nnetwork by education level, interest group or joviality. User can also\r\nadjust the year and month to view the network changes over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: participants with relatively higher centrality betweenness\r\nvalue are highlighted in red in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe social network for the selected group will be shown as facet of\r\nindividual sub groups.\r\n2.2.3 Network by Individual\r\nTo view the network diagram for individual participant, user can\r\nswitch to the Network by Individual menu item, where user can adjust the\r\nperiod and select participant ID or interest group to view their network\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3 Predominant Business\r\nUnder Predominant Business Analysis, the application provides sub\r\nmodules for:\r\nOverall Town Map\r\nCost Analysis\r\nCheck-in Analysis\r\nRevenue Analysis\r\n\r\n2.3.1 Overall Town Map\r\nAfter user selects Overall Town Map from the side menu bar, a\r\ndashboard with summary of the no. of buildings, and venue types\r\nincluding apartments, employers, pubs, restaurants and schools will be\r\nshown on top of the page.\r\n\r\nThe first plot will show the geographical region of the town divided\r\ninto central, east, north-west, and south regions.\r\n\r\nThe building types will be shown in the next plot with different\r\ncolors for commercial, residential or school buildings.\r\n\r\nNext, user can select the venue type including apartments, employers,\r\npubs, restaurants and schools to be plotted in the map to view the\r\nlocation and distribution of business in the town.\r\nUser can choose to plot all venue types with different colors or plot\r\nonly individual venue type. Additional details such as geographic region\r\nor building type can be selected to add on to the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3.2 Cost Analysis\r\nUser can go to the Cost Analysis from the side menu bar to explore\r\nthe cost of the business in the town.\r\nFirst, user can select the venue type. Once done, the map plot on the\r\nright will be updated with the selected venue type plotted as\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe color/size of the points will be determined based on the cost\r\nvalue such as food cost, rental cost, pub cost, school cost and job\r\nrate. This helps the user to identify the areas in the city that has\r\nhigher or lower business cost.\r\n\r\nIn this page, user can also select the x, y variables, type of\r\nstatistical test, plot type to perform a pairwise statistical test to\r\ncheck if there’s significant difference of the business cost in\r\ndifferent regions.\r\n\r\nUser can also key in the plot title and the plot will be updated\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n2.3.3 Check-in Analysis\r\nAfter user switches to the Check-in Analysis, the no. of daily\r\ncheck-ins will be plotted under the “Plots” tab.\r\nCheck-in plots\r\nIn this tab, user can select restaurant or pub for check-in analysis,\r\nand adjust the date range to view the trend changes.\r\n\r\nAfter mouse over on the plot, more details of the check-in counts\r\nwill be displayed in the tooltip for the restaurant or pub. With\r\nplotly graph, user can also choose to view individual\r\nrestaurant/pub or select multiple ones.\r\n\r\nThe restaurants or pubs will also be shown in the map plot with color\r\nand size indicating the no. of check-ins. This helps user to identify\r\nthe region and areas in the city with prosperous business.\r\n\r\nCorrelation test\r\nUser can switch to the correlation test tab to perform correlation\r\ntest on selected variables such as no. of check-ins against pub cost or\r\nfood cost.\r\n\r\nUser is allowed to select the type of test, display marginal graph\r\nand edit graph title.\r\n\r\n2.3.4 Revenue Analysis\r\nUser can click Revenue Analysis from the side menu bar to go to the\r\nfunction to check monthly revenue, customers, revenue per customer for\r\nrestaurants or pubs.\r\nRevenue plots User can select the revenue parameter to be plotted on\r\nthe graph and adjust the period.\r\nAfter mouse over on the plot, user can examine the revenue value for\r\nindividual restaurant or pub and select individual or multiple\r\nrestaurants/pubs to shown in the plot if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe restaurants or pubs will also be shown in the map plot with color\r\nand size indicating the revenue or revenue/customer, which aims to help\r\nuser to examine the business by region and areas in the city.\r\n\r\nStatistical test\r\nUser can switch to the statistical test tab to select the x, y\r\nvariables, type of statistical test, plot type to perform a pairwise\r\nstatistical test to check if there’s significant difference of the\r\nbusiness revenue in different regions.\r\n\r\nUser can edit the plot title if required.\r\n\r\nUser can also perform the correlation test on selected variables such\r\nas revenue against pub or food cost as well as no. of customers against\r\npub or food cost.\r\n\r\nUser is allowed to select the type of test, display marginal graph\r\nand edit graph title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Overview\r\nIn this project, our team will try on building web-enabled visual\r\nanalytics application by using R Shiny. The project aims to democratize\r\ndata and analytics. The application will focus and emphasize on\r\ninteractivity and effective integration of techniques from data\r\nanalytics and data visualization.\r\n2. Project Topic\r\nThe topic of Visual Analytics Project will be based on VAST Challenge 2022.\r\nOur team will choose Challenge 1 and build a Shiny Application to answer\r\nthe questions of the Challenge. Challenge 1 is to understand the city’s\r\ndemographics and relationships. We will analyse the available data about\r\nthe social networks and other information of the city to learn about the\r\ncity’s demographics, its neighborhoods, and its business base.\r\n3. Motivation\r\nThe purpose of the project is to help the city planning team of\r\nEngagement, Ohio USA to understand the current state of the city and\r\nidentify opportunities for future growth. The visual analytics exercise\r\ncan use related visual analytic techniques to analyse the data collected\r\nfrom the representative residents using the city’s urban planning\r\napp.\r\n4. Problems and Issues\r\nIn this project, we will solve three main problems of Challenge 1.\r\nFirst, assuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s\r\npopulation, we will characterize the demographics of the town. Also,\r\nconsidering the social activities in the community, we will describe the\r\npatterns in the social networks in the town. Lastly, we will identify\r\nthe predominant business base of the town, and describe patterns we\r\nobserve.\r\n5. Related Work and Approach\r\n5.1 Demographics\r\nPopulation can be visualized through a variety of charts such as pie\r\ncharts, maps, line charts, bar charts and etc, which are all helpful to\r\nvisualize population.\r\nFor age, we can use a stacked bar plot(Global\r\nage-sex-specific fertility, mortality, healthy life expectancy (HALE),\r\nand population estimates in 204 countries and territories, 1950–2019: a\r\ncomprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease\r\nStudy 2019), pie or donut chart to reveal how people’s ages are\r\ndistributed in a single population group.\r\nFor education level, there is a study about Mapping\r\ndisparities in education across low- and middle-income countries\r\npublished on Nature in 2019. They studied the relationship of the change\r\nin average educational attainment rate and income. They use terminal\r\nmapping to visualize it.\r\n5.2 Social activities\r\nFor the social analysis, we can use the following library packages to\r\nvisualize people ’s social activities and patterns:\r\nvisNetwork\r\ngeomnet\r\nigraph\r\nReferences:\r\nSocial\r\nNetwork Visualization with R\r\nVisual\r\nSocial Network Analysis in R and Gephi Part II\r\n5.3 Predominant business base\r\nFor this analysis, we will try visualizing the no. of check-ins or\r\ntravels of different locations and venue types by interactive line\r\ncharts. We will also try revealing and describing spatial patterns and\r\nrelationships on maps using the following R packages:\r\nsf\r\ntmap\r\nraster\r\nstars\r\nmicromap\r\ngeofacet\r\nFor the location data in the dataset, we can learn how to use polygon\r\nand apply to visualize the location of the business bases.\r\n5.4 Data\r\njournalists and other dataviz professionals\r\nAlberto Cairo - University of Miami, Data Visualization Studio and weblog on visualization,\r\ninfographics and data journalism\r\nDavid Candless\r\n(Information is Beautiful)\r\nGuardian\r\ndatablog\r\nJohn Grimade, Ohio University,\r\nSchool of Visual Communication.\r\nHans Rosling TED\r\ntalks\r\nMoritz Stefaner - freelance\r\ninformation visualiser\r\nEdward Tufte (books -\r\nThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information)\r\nNathan Yau - flowing\r\ndata\r\nStamen Design\r\nNaomi\r\nRobbins - Forbes\r\n6. Storyboards and Prototypes\r\nBelow are some initial prototypes/graphs that our group generated\r\nusing Tableau and R. Functions will be built on Shiny application for\r\nusers to interactively generate similar graphs.\r\n\r\n6.1 Demograhics\r\nFor the discrete values such as age, we can use line plot and use\r\ncolor to denote the number.\r\nFor age group and have kids, we can use pyramid plot.\r\n\r\nFor the relationship of education level and kids, we can use stacked\r\nhistgram.\r\nimageFor joviality, we can use violin plot.\r\nimageimageThe demographics can focus on the interactivity and provide more\r\nflexible choices of inputs variables in the Shiny application to give\r\nusers better experience when visualizing demographics of the city.\r\n6.2 Social activities\r\nTo observe the patterns of the social activities of the city, we use\r\ntwo different layouts with Gephi to visualize the social network of the\r\ncity. The edge weight could be used to indicate the no. of interactions\r\nbetween 2 parties, e.g. if the 2 residents have more interactions, the\r\nedge weight will be higher.\r\nAnother possible technique is to use heatmap to show the no. of\r\ninteractions for each resident across the year or total no. of\r\ninteractions for all residents across the year.\r\nWe can explore more about the social communities with the social\r\nactivities and participants attributes using R. For example, we can\r\ndetect the communities among the social network and analyse the\r\ndemographics of the clusters/groups to identify common\r\ncharacteristics.\r\nWe can also try identifying the dominant social influencer in the\r\ncommunity who has the highest no. of interactions with others and the\r\ncharacteristics of these residents. On the other hand, the inactive\r\nresidents with little social interaction could also be identified.\r\nIn addition, we can try to visualize the social network dynamics with\r\nthe timestamp variable in the social network dataset and see if any\r\nsignificant changes happen over the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3 Predominant business base\r\nFor the area distribution of various types of businesses in the town,\r\nwe can explore below scatter plots or generate similar map plots.\r\n\r\nFor the no. of check-ins at various locations, we can use line charts\r\nand interactively filter based on venue type.\r\n For example, we can see pub-1344\r\nseems to have highest customer volumes among all pubs.\r\n Restarurant-1801 seems to have the\r\nhighest customer volumes throughout the year among all restaurants.\r\n\r\nBesides check-ins, it is also possible to look at Travels data and\r\nuse heatmaps to show the most popular locations. We can look at the\r\nmapping from each venue (pub, restaurant, school, employer, and\r\napartment) to Buildings and identify which building is predominant,\r\ni.e. consists of various types of businesses or consists of more\r\nemployers/pubs/restaurants than the other buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
