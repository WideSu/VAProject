Overview\r\nIn this project, our team will try on building web-enabled visual\r\nanalytics application by using R Shiny. The project aims to democratize\r\ndata and analytics. The application will focus and emphasize on\r\ninteractivity and effective integration of techniques from data\r\nanalytics and data visualization.\r\n2. Project Topic\r\nThe topic of Visual Analytics Project will be based on VAST Challenge 2022.\r\nOur team will choose Challenge 1 and build a Shiny Application to answer\r\nthe questions of the Challenge. Challenge 1 is to understand the city’s\r\ndemographics and relationships. We will analyse the available data about\r\nthe social networks and other information of the city to learn about the\r\ncity’s demographics, its neighborhoods, and its business base.\r\n3. Motivation\r\nThe purpose of the project is to help the city planning team of\r\nEngagement, Ohio USA to understand the current state of the city and\r\nidentify opportunities for future growth. The visual analytics exercise\r\ncan use related visual analytic techniques to analyse the data collected\r\nfrom the representative residents using the city’s urban planning\r\napp.\r\n4. Problems and Issues\r\nIn this project, we will solve three main problems of Challenge 1.\r\nFirst, assuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s\r\npopulation, we will characterize the demographics of the town. Also,\r\nconsidering the social activities in the community, we will describe the\r\npatterns in the social networks in the town. Lastly, we will identify\r\nthe predominant business base of the town, and describe patterns we\r\nobserve.\r\n5. Related Work and Approach\r\n5.1 Demographics\r\nPopulation can be visualized through a variety of chars such as pie\r\ncharts, maps, line charts, bar charts and more can all help you\r\nvisualize population.\r\nFor age, we can use a stacked bar plot(Global\r\nage-sex-specific fertility, mortality, healthy life expectancy (HALE),\r\nand population estimates in 204 countries and territories, 1950–2019: a\r\ncomprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease\r\nStudy 2019), pie or donut chart to reveal how people’s ages are\r\nsplit in a single population group.\r\nFor education level, there’re study about Mapping\r\ndisparities in education across low- and middle-income countries\r\npublished on Nature in 2019. They studied the relationship of the change\r\nin average educational attainment rate and income. They use terminal\r\nmapping to visualize it.\r\n5.2 Social activities\r\nFor this analysis, we will be using the following library\r\npackages:\r\nvisNetwork\r\ngeomnet\r\nigraph\r\nWe can visualize people’s social activity by turning participants\r\ninto nodes and their financial activity into edges.\r\nReferences:\r\nSocial\r\nNetwork Visualization with R\r\nVisual\r\nSocial Network Analysis in R and Gephi Part II\r\n5.3 Predominant business base\r\nFor this analysis, we will try visualizing the no. of check-ins or\r\ntravels of different locations and venue types by interactive line\r\ncharts. We will also try revealing and describing spatial patterns and\r\nrelationships on maps using the following R packages:\r\nsf\r\ntmap\r\nraster\r\nstars\r\nmicromap\r\ngeofacet\r\n5.4 Data\r\njournalists and other dataviz professionals\r\nAlberto Cairo - University of Miami, Data Visualization Studio and weblog on visualization,\r\ninfographics and data journalism\r\nDavid Candless\r\n(Information is Beautiful)\r\nGuardian\r\ndatablog\r\nJohn Grimade, Ohio University,\r\nSchool of Visual Communication.\r\nHans Rosling TED\r\ntalks\r\nMoritz Stefaner - freelance\r\ninformation visualiser\r\nEdward Tufte (books -\r\nThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information)\r\nNathan Yau - flowing\r\ndata\r\nStamen Design\r\nNaomi\r\nRobbins - Forbes\r\n6. Storyboards and Prototypes\r\nBelow are some initial prototypes/graphs that our group generated\r\nusing Tableau and R. Functions will be built on Shiny application for\r\nusers to interactively generate similar graphs.\r\n\r\n6.1 Demograhics\r\nFor the discrete values such as age, we can use line plot and use\r\ncolor to denote the number.\r\n\r\nFor household size, education level, interest group and have kids, we\r\ncan use donuts plot.\r\n\r\n6.2 Social activities\r\nTo be filled in\r\n6.3 Predominant business base\r\nFor the area distribution of various types of businesses in the town,\r\nwe can explore below scatter plots or generate similar map plots.\r\n\r\nFor the no. of check-ins at various locations, we can use line charts\r\nand interactively filter based on venue type.\r\n For example, we can see pub-1344\r\nseems to have highest customer volumes among all pubs.\r\n Restarurant-1801 seems to have the\r\nhighest customer volumes throughout the year among all restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
