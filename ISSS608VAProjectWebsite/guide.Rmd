<img src="image/guide-s1-08.png"/>

In the next row, first a box violin plot will be shown with pairwise statistical test on participant's joviality by education level. 

<img src="image/guide-s1-09.png"/>

The other plot is the correlogram for the relationship between participant's joviality and wage.
