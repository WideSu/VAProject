# 1. Overview

In this project, our team will try on building web-enabled visual analytics application by using R Shiny. The project aims to democratize data and analytics. The application will focus and emphasize on interactivity and effective integration of techniques from data analytics and data visualization.

# 2. Project Topic

The topic of Visual Analytics Project will be based on [VAST Challenge 2022](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/). Our team will choose Challenge 1 and build a Shiny Application to answer the questions of the Challenge. Challenge 1 is to understand the city’s demographics and relationships. We will analyse the available data about the social networks and other information of the city to learn about the city’s demographics, its neighborhoods, and its business base.

# 3. Motivation 

The purpose of the project is to help the city planning team of Engagement, Ohio USA to understand the current state of the city and identify opportunities for future growth. The visual analytics exercise can use related visual analytic techniques to analyse the data collected from the representative residents using the city’s urban planning app.


# 4. Problems and Issues

In this project, we will solve three main problems of Challenge 1. First, assuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s population, we will characterize the demographics of the town. Also, considering  the social activities in the community, we will describe the patterns in the social networks in the town. Lastly, we will identify the predominant business base of the town, and describe patterns we observe. 


# 5. Related Work and Approach

## 5.1 Demographics

Population can be visualized through a variety of chars such as pie charts, maps, line charts, bar charts and more can all help you visualize population. 

For age, we can use a stacked bar plot([Global age-sex-specific fertility, mortality, healthy life expectancy (HALE), and population estimates in 204 countries and territories, 1950–2019: a comprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30977-6/fulltext)), pie or donut chart to reveal how people’s ages are split in a single population group. 

For education level, there're study about [Mapping disparities in education across low- and middle-income countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1872-1) published on Nature in 2019. They studied the relationship of the change in average educational attainment rate and income. They use terminal mapping to visualize it.

## 5.2 Social activities

For this analysis, we will be using the following library packages:

- visNetwork
- geomnet
- [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/)

We can visualize people's social activity by turning participants into nodes and their financial activity into edges.

# 6. Storyboards and Prototypes

## 6.1 Demograhics

For the discrete values such as age, we can use line plot and use color to denote the number.

 For household size and have kids, we can use donuts plot.
