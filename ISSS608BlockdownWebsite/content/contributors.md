Thank you to all the folks who have contributed both technical and creative skills to this project:

+ [HUANG ANNI:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annihuang2021/) (designed 5 of the custom color themes, made illustrations for the workshop, and provided general aesthetic feedback along the way)

+ [NI JUNQIU: ](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/) (debugged headroom.js and lent his panelset.js code to the theme)

+ [WANG TIANQI:](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) (awesome illustrations of campfires, seedlings, and evergreens, as well as my R Markdown hedgehog mascot :hedgehog:)


And last but not least, the team at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for developing a Hugo theme with such great bones: <https://github.com/formspree/blogophonic-hugo>
